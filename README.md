# Free Throw Theme
Starter theme for Genesis Framework focusing on LMS plugin usage

Genesis seems to be made more for blogs, so I want to try to focus specifically on an LMS theme.
For now I'll start it as a plain vanilla LMS, and then maybe can add either additional child themes or plugins for specific LMS platforms.

Once this is completed I will open issues.

WordPress LMS Platforms:

It's still in development, so I would not recommend installing it yet.
